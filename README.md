# Scene-It

## Overview

Scene-It is a front-end application that encourages the creation of a watchlist for television and film.
HTTP requests made via Axios to the Open Movie Database API returns
rendered results onto the DOM, and allows for quick additions to a watchlist saved onto
localStorage. The watchlist will store the selections added until removed from the list or
until localStorage is deleted. This project has been deployed via Netlify with a link down below.
